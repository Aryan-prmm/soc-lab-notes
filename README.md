# Soc-Lab-notes
Hands-on SOC analyst labs documenting alert analysis, log investigation, and incident triage using TryHackMe and SIEM-based workflows.

## Lab 1: SOC Fundamentals (TryHackMe – SOC Level 1)

### Focus
Understanding the role of a Tier-1 SOC analyst and the lifecycle of security alerts.

### Key Learnings
- Responsibilities of a Tier-1 SOC analyst
- How alerts are monitored and triaged
- Importance of severity, priority, and escalation
- Difference between detection and response

### SOC Perspective
This lab reinforced how SOC analysts investigate alerts, validate evidence, and decide whether escalation is required.

## Lab 2: SOC L1 Alert Triage (TryHackMe)

### Scenario
SOC alerts requiring triage to determine whether activity is malicious or benign.

### Evidence Reviewed
Indicators, logs, and contextual information associated with the alerts.

### Analysis
Evaluated alert evidence to differentiate between true and false positives using context and impact.

### Decision

### SOC Perspective
This lab reinforced the importance of accurate alert triage to reduce alert fatigue and ensure timely escalation of genuine threats.
